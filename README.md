## 🔧 Libraries and Their Significance

### 📦 1. `numpy`

```python
import numpy as np
```

* **Why**: Handles numerical operations efficiently.
* **Use**: Converts price data into NumPy arrays, enabling vectorized operations for speed.
* **Significance**: Used to reshape, slice, and format time series data into supervised learning format.

---

### 📦 2. `pandas`

```python
import pandas as pd
```

* **Why**: For data manipulation and DataFrame structure.
* **Use**: Loads the dataset from Yahoo Finance and handles date-based indexing, filtering, etc.
* **Significance**: Makes time series processing more intuitive and readable, especially when handling `df[['Close']]`.

---

### 📦 3. `matplotlib.pyplot`

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

* **Why**: For data visualization.
* **Use**: Plots actual vs. predicted prices.
* **Significance**: Critical for evaluating model performance visually. Trends and anomalies are easily seen.

---

### 📦 4. `matplotlib.dates`

```python
import matplotlib.dates as mdates
```

* **Why**: Enhances time-based X-axis formatting.
* **Use**: Converts x-axis to show years in readable format.
* **Significance**: Improves the clarity of stock prediction graphs over long durations (2015–2024).

---

### 📦 5. `yfinance`

```python
import yfinance as yf
```

* **Why**: Automatically fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
* **Use**: Downloads daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) values for a ticker (e.g., `AAPL`).
* **Significance**: Avoids the need to manually maintain or purchase stock datasets.

---

### 📦 6. `sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
```

* **Why**: Scales all stock prices into a standard range (usually 0 to 1).
* **Use**: Normalizes input features to stabilize model training and reduce weight explosion.
* **Significance**: Ensures neural network convergence during gradient descent.

---

### 📦 7. `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

* **Why**: To split data into training and test sets.
* **Use**: Ensures that the model learns from historical data and is validated on unseen data.
* **Significance**: Vital for preventing overfitting and assessing generalization.

---

### 📦 8. `tensorflow.keras.models.Sequential`

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
```

* **Why**: Creates a linear stack of layers for neural networks.
* **Use**: Both MLP and LSTM models are built using this structure.
* **Significance**: Simplifies model definition and debugging.

---

### 📦 9. `tensorflow.keras.layers`

```python
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, LSTM
```

* **Dense**: Fully connected layers; essential for learning nonlinear relationships.
* **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
* **LSTM**: A type of RNN layer that remembers past time steps and learns sequential dependencies.

---

## 🧠 Entities and Their Significance

### 🏷️ `Close` Price

* **Why**: Closing price reflects the final trading value of a stock each day and is widely used for forecasting.
* **Use**: Extracted from the full Yahoo Finance dataset for modeling.
* **Significance**: Simplifies the problem to univariate time series prediction.

---

### 📈 `window_size`

* **Why**: Defines how many past days the model looks at to predict the next price.
* **Typical values**:

  * MLP: 10 days
  * LSTM: 60 days
* **Significance**: The window creates temporal context. Larger windows = more trend capture.

---

## ⚙️ Approaches Taken and Why

### 🔹 1. **Supervised Learning for Time Series**

* **Why**: Neural networks require input-output pairs for training.
* **Approach**:

  * Input `X` = Prices from day t-10 to t-1
  * Output `y` = Price on day t
* **Significance**: Converts unstructured time series into tabular supervised learning format.

---

### 🔹 2. **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**

* **Why**: Acts as a baseline model with a simple architecture.
* **Structure**:

  * Input → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dropout(0.2) → Dense(32, ReLU) → Output(1)
* **Advantages**:

  * Fast to train
  * Easy to interpret
* **Limitations**:

  * Ignores time dependency
  * Only works well for short memory patterns

---

### 🔹 3. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**

* **Why**: Stock prices are sequential. LSTM can remember past values and trends.
* **Structure**:

  * LSTM(50, return\_sequences=True) → Dropout → LSTM(50) → Dropout → Dense(1)
* **Advantages**:

  * Handles long-term dependencies
  * Learns seasonal trends or cycles
* **Significance**: More realistic modeling of real-world stock movement

---

### 🔹 4. **Dropout Regularization**

* **Why**: Prevents overfitting during training.
* **How**: Randomly deactivates a fraction of neurons during training.
* **Significance**: Forces network to generalize better.

---

### 🔹 5. **Adam Optimizer**

* **Why**: Adaptive learning rate for faster convergence.
* **How**: Combines RMSprop and Momentum optimizations.
* **Significance**: Makes model training stable and efficient even with noisy gradients.

---

### 🔹 6. **Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

* **Why**: Penalizes large deviations in predictions.
* **Equation**:

  $$
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{\text{true}} - y_{\text{pred}})^2
  $$
* **Significance**: Standard for regression problems like price prediction.

---

### 🔹 7. **Inverse Transformation**

* **Why**: Convert normalized predictions back to actual prices.
* **Use**: `scaler.inverse_transform()`
* **Significance**: Makes predictions interpretable and visually comparable with real prices.

---

### 🔹 8. **Time-based Plotting**

* **Why**: Stocks are evaluated across dates.
* **Use**: `mdates.YearLocator()` for clean yearly ticks.
* **Significance**: Helps in year-wise performance comparison.

---

 Final Thoughts: Why This Approach Works

* **Simplifies complex finance data** into clean numerical structures.
* **Combines** traditional time series modeling with modern deep learning.
* Uses both **basic MLP** for entry-level understanding and **LSTM** for real-world power.
* Can be **extended** to more advanced architectures (e.g., Attention, Transformers).
* **Modular** design makes it ideal for transfer to other domains (e.g., antenna design, weather prediction).
